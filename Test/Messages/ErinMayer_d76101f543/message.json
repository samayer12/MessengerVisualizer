Heat up the vodka for 5 minutes or so. It should not boil. Just get it nice and warm. Add in the herbs (in the tea bag if you have it), and turn off the flame. Let it steep for 20 minutes. While you're waiting take your shot glass and melt shredded Parmesan cheese around the rim (you don't have to do this. But I tried it, it was good) and heat up the cheesy bread. Once it is done steeping, you can chill the vodka, or just drink it warm. I can't tell which is better. Once you decide, go ahead and stick the self adhesive fake mustache to the bottom of the shot glass. Pour in 3/4 Pizza Vodka tea, 1/4 bloody mary mix. Drink it and chase it with the cheesy bread. When you lift the cup to your face, the mustache should line up just right so you look like a pizza John. Merry Pizzamas everyone!",
